# Sweet Bliss Cupcakes 🍰

Sweet Bliss Cupcakes is a modern cupcake-store-landing-page built as an ultra-lightweight-spa using a framework-free-spa architecture.

This project demonstrates how to build a high-performance-landing website using pure HTML, CSS (Oat), and minimal JavaScript — without React, Angular, or any heavy framework.

It is intentionally designed as a 21kb-spa-demo to showcase how powerful a vanilla-spa-landing approach can be when performance, SEO, and simplicity are prioritized.
